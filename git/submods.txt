Submodules are hard.

I guess I would recommend git cloning first to see if you like the plugin, then deleting that and git submoduling if you actually do like it.

Add: "git submodule add [link] [path]" # IMPORTANT: don't use a full path (i.e. starting from /). stick to a relative one
Remove: uhhhhhhh
	try these commands:
		git ls --stage [path to submodule dir]
		git rm --cached [path to submodule dir]
	edit the .dotfiles/.git/config and .dotfiles/.gitmodules and delete all relevant lines
	delete the directory
